/**
 * AI Video Generation Client
 *
 * REFACTORED: This file now re-exports from the modular ai-video/ structure.
 * The implementation has been split into focused modules for better maintainability:
 *
 * - ai-video/core/       - FAL API request utilities, polling, streaming
 * - ai-video/generators/ - Video generation functions by category
 * - ai-video/models/     - Model-specific utilities (Sora2, etc.)
 * - ai-video/validation/ - Input validation functions
 * - ai-video/api.ts      - High-level API utilities
 *
 * For new imports, prefer importing directly from "@qcut-app/lib/ai-video" or specific submodules.
 * This file maintains backward compatibility with existing consumers.
